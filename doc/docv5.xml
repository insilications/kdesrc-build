<para>
<application>kdesrc-build</application> is a script to help the <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> community install <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.kde.org/"><orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname></link> software from its <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://git-scm.com/"><application>Git</application></link> and <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://subversion.tigris.org/"><application>Subversion</application></link> source repositories,
and continue to update that software afterwards.
It is particularly intended to support those who need to supporting testing and
development of <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> software, including users testing bugfixes and developers
working on new features.
</para>

<para>The <application>kdesrc-build</application> script can be configured to maintain a single individual

<title>Getting Started</title>

<para>
In this chapter, we show how to use the <application>kdesrc-build</application> to checkout modules from
the <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> repository and build them. We also provide a basic explanation of the
<orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> source code structure and the steps you have to perform before running
the script.
</para>

<para>
All topics present in this chapter are covered with even more detail in the
<link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://community.kde.org/Guidelines_and_HOWTOs/Build_from_source">

<link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://community.kde.org/"><orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> Community Wiki</link>.
If you are compiling <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> for the first time, it is a good idea to read
it, or consult it as a reference source. You will find detailed information
about packaging tools and requirements, common compilation pitfalls and
strategies and information about running your new <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> installation.

<title>Preparing the System to Build <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname></title>

<section xml:id="before-building-users">
<title>Setup a new user account</title>

<para>
It is recommended that you use a different user account to build, install,
and run your <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> software from, since less permissions are required, and
to avoid interfering with your distribution's packages.
If you already have <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> packages installed, the best choice
would be to create a different (dedicated) user to build and run the new <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname>.
</para>

<tip><para>Leaving your system <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> untouched also allows you to have an
emergency fallback in case a coding mistake causes your latest software build
to be unusable.
</para></tip>

<para>
You can do also setup to install to a system-wide directory (<abbrev>e.g.</abbrev> <filename class="directory">/usr/src/local</filename>) if you wish. This document
does not cover this installation type, since we assume you know what you are doing.

<title>Ensure your system is ready to build <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> software</title>

<para>Before using the <application>kdesrc-build</application> script (or any other building
strategy) you must install the development tools and libraries needed for <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname>.
The nearly complete list of required tools can be found from
the <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://community.kde.org/Guidelines_and_HOWTOs/Build_from_source#Install_required_devel_packages"><orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname>
Community Wiki Build Requirements</link> page.
</para>

<para>Here is a list of some of the things you will need:</para>
<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>You will need <application>CMake</application>, this software is what <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> uses to handle
build-time configuration of the source code and generation of the specific build
commands for your system.  The required version will vary
depending on what versions of <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> software you are building (see TechBase for
specifics), but with modern distributions the <application>CMake</application> included with your distribution
should be quite sufficient.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>You must also install the source control clients needed to checkout
the <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> source code. This means you need at least the following:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>The <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://git-scm.com/">Git
source control manager</link>, which is used for all <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href=" https://commits.kde.org/">source code</link></para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Although it is not required, the <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://bazaar.canonical.com/">Bazaar</link> source control manager is
used for a single module (libdbusmenu-qt) that is required for the <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname>
libraries. Most users can install this library through their distribution
packages but <application>kdesrc-build</application> supports building it as well if you desire. But to
build libdbusmenu-qt, you must have Bazaar installed.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist></listitem>

<listitem><para>The Perl scripting language is required for <application>kdesrc-build</application>, some <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname>
repositories, and <trademark class="trade">Qt</trademark> (if you build that from source).</para>

<para>The Perl that comes with your distribution should be suitable (it needs to be at
least Perl 5.14), but you will also need some additional modules (<application>kdesrc-build</application>
will warn if they are not present):</para>

<itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>IO::Socket::SSL</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>JSON::PP or JSON::XS</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>YAML::PP, YAML::XS, or YAML::Syck</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</listitem>

<listitem><para>You will need a full C++ development environment (compiler, standard library, runtime,
and any required development packages).  The minimum required versions vary based on the <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> module:
the <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> Frameworks 5 collection supports the oldest compilers, while <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> Plasma 5 and <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> Applications
tend to require more recent compilers.</para>
<para>The GCC 4.8 or Clang 4 compilers are the minimum recommended.  Many distributions support easily
installing these tools using a <quote>build-essentials</quote> package, an option to install
"build dependencies" with <trademark class="trade">Qt</trademark>, or similar features.  The KDE Community Wiki has a page <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://community.kde.org/Guidelines_and_HOWTOs/Build_from_source/Install_the_dependencies">tracking
recommended packages for major distributions</link>.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para>You will need a build tool that actually performs the compilation steps (as generated by <application>CMake</application>). GNU Make is recommended and should be available through your package manager. <application>CMake</application> does support others options, such as the <application>Ninja</application> build tool, which can be used by <application>kdesrc-build</application> using the <link linkend="conf-custom-build-command">custom-build-command</link> configuration file option.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Finally, you will need the appropriate <trademark class="trade">Qt</trademark> libraries (including development packages)
for the version of <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> software you are building.  <application>kdesrc-build</application> does not officially support building <trademark class="trade">Qt</trademark> 5 (the current major version), so it is recommended to use your distribution's development packages or to
see the KDE Community wiki page on <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://community.kde.org/Guidelines_and_HOWTOs/Build_from_source/OwnQt5">self-building Qt 5</link>.
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<note><para>Most operating system distributions include a method of easily
installing required development tools. Consult the Community Wiki page <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://community.kde.org/Guidelines_and_HOWTOs/Build_from_source#Install_required_devel_packages">Required devel packages</link> to see
if these instructions are already available.</para></note>

<important><para>
Some of these packages are divided into libraries (or programs or utilities),
and development packages. You will need at least the program or library
<emphasis>and</emphasis> its development package.

</section>

<section xml:id="setup-rcfile">
<title>Prepare the configuration file</title>

<para><application>kdesrc-build</application> uses a <link linkend="configure-data">configuration
file</link> (located at <filename>~/.kdesrc-buildrc</filename>) to control
which modules are built, where they are installed to, etc.</para>

<para>You can use a program included with <application>kdesrc-build</application>, called
<application>kdesrc-build-setup</application> in order to prepare a simple
kdesrc-build configuration. You can then edit the
<filename>~/.kdesrc-buildrc</filename> from there to make any changes you see
fit.</para>

<para><application>kdesrc-build-setup</application> itself runs from a terminal
(instead of using a graphical interface), just like <application>kdesrc-build</application>, so you can
use it even if you have no graphical interface available yet.</para>

<section xml:id="setup-rcfile-manually">
<title>Manual setup of configuration file</title>

<para>You can also setup your configuration file manually, by copying the
included sample configuration file
<filename>kdesrc-buildrc-kf5-sample</filename> to
<filename>~/.kdesrc-buildrc</filename> and then editing the file.  <xref linkend="kdesrc-buildrc"/> will be a useful reference for this, especially its
<link linkend="conf-options-table">table of configuration options</link>.
</para>

<para><application>kdesrc-build</application> contains many recommended configuration files to support

<section xml:id="configure-data">
<title>Setting the Configuration Data</title>

<para>
To use <application>kdesrc-build</application>, you should have a file in your home directory called
<filename>.kdesrc-buildrc</filename>, which sets the general options and sets the modules
you would like to download and build.
</para>

<note><para>It is possible to use different configuration files for <application>kdesrc-build</application>,
which is described in <xref linkend="kdesrc-buildrc"/>. If you need to use
multiple configurations, please see that section. Here, we will assume the
configuration is stored in <filename>~/.kdesrc-buildrc</filename>.</para></note>

<para>
The easiest way to proceed is to use the
<filename>kdesrc-buildrc-kf5-sample</filename> file as a template, changing global
options to match your wants, and also change the list of modules you want to
build.
</para>

<para>
The default settings should be appropriate to perform a
<orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> build. Some settings that you may wish to alter include:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><link linkend="conf-kdedir">kdedir</link>, which changes the
destination directory that your <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> software is installed to. This defaults to
<filename class="directory">~/kde</filename>, which is a single-user
installation.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><link linkend="conf-branch-group">branch-group</link>, which can
be
used to choose the appropriate branch of development for the <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> modules as a
whole. There are many supported build configurations but you will likely want to
choose <option>kf5-qt5</option> so that <application>kdesrc-build</application> downloads the latest code
based on <trademark class="trade">Qt</trademark> 5 and <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> Frameworks 5.</para>

<tip><para><application>kdesrc-build</application> will use a default branch group if you do not choose
one, but this default will change over time, so it's better to choose one so
that the branch group does not change unexpectedly.</para></tip>
</listitem>

<listitem><para><link linkend="conf-source-dir">source-dir</link>, to control the directory
<application>kdesrc-build</application> uses for downloading the source code, running the build process, and saving
logs.
This defaults to <filename class="directory">~/kdesrc</filename>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><link linkend="conf-cmake-options">cmake-options</link>, which
sets the options to pass to the <application>CMake</application> command when building each module.
Typically this is used to set between <quote>debug</quote> or
<quote>release</quote> builds, to enable (or disable) optional features, or to
pass information to the build process about the location of required libraries.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><link linkend="conf-make-options">make-options</link>, which
sets the options used when actually running the <application>make</application>
command to build each module (once <application>CMake</application> has established the build system).
</para>

<para>The most typical option is <option>-j<replaceable>N</replaceable></option>,
where <replaceable>N</replaceable> should be replaced with the maximum number of
compile jobs you wish to allow.  A higher number (up to the number of logical CPUs
your system has available) leads to quicker builds, but requires more system resources.
</para>

<tip><para><application>kdesrc-build</application> sets the option <option><link linkend="conf-num-cores">num-cores</link></option> to
the detected number of available processing cores. You can use this value
in your own configuration file to avoid having to set it manually.

Do not despair!
</para>

<para><application>kdesrc-build</application> logs the output of every command it runs. By default,
the log files are kept in <filename class="directory">~/kdesrc/log</filename>. To see what
the caused an error for a module in the last <application>kdesrc-build</application> command, usually
it is sufficient to look at <filename class="directory">~/kdesrc/log/latest/<replaceable>module-name</replaceable>/error.log</filename>.</para>

<tip><para>Perhaps the easiest way to find out what error caused a module to
fail to build is to search backward with a case-insensitive search, starting
from the end of the file looking for the word <literal>error</literal>.  Once
that is found, scroll up to make sure there are no other error messages nearby.
The first error message in a group is usually the underlying
problem.</para></tip>

<para>In that file, you will see the error that caused the build to fail for
that module. If the file says (at the bottom) that you are missing some
packages, try installing the package (including any appropriate -dev packages)
before trying to build that module again. Make sure that when you run
<application>kdesrc-build</application> again to pass the <link linkend="cmdline-reconfigure">--reconfigure</link> option so that
<application>kdesrc-build</application> forces the module to check for the missing packages
again.</para>

<para>Or, if the error appears to be a build error (such as a syntax error,
<quote>incorrect prototype</quote>, <quote>unknown type</quote>, or similar)
then it is probably an error with the <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> source, which will hopefully be
resolved within a few days. If it is not resolved within that time, feel free
to mail the <email>kde-devel@kde.org</email> mailing list (subscription may be
required first) in order to report the build failure.</para>

<title>Module Sets</title>

<para>The <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> source code is decomposed into a great number of relatively
small Git-based repositories. To make it easier to manage the large number of
repositories involved in any useful <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname>-based install, <application>kdesrc-build</application> supports
grouping multiple modules and treating the group as a <quote>module set</quote>.
</para>

<section xml:id="module-set-concept">
<title>The basic module set concept</title>

<para>By using a module set, you can quickly declare many Git modules to be
downloaded and built, as if you'd typed out a separate module declaration for
each one. The <link linkend="conf-repository">repository</link> option is
handled specially to setup where each module is downloaded from, and every
other option contained in the module set is copied to every module generated
in this fashion.</para>

<example xml:id="example-using-module-sets">
<title>Using module sets</title>

<para>In <xref linkend="example-using-module-sets"/> a brief module set is

every module given in <option>use-modules</option>, that an individual module
has been declared, with its <option>repository</option> equal to the
module-set's <option>repository</option> followed immediately by the given
module name.</para>

<para>In addition, other options can be passed in a module set, which are
copied to every new module that is created this way. By using module-set it is
possible to quickly declare many Git modules that are all based on the same
repository URL. In addition, it is possible to give module-sets a name (as shown
in the example), which allows you to quickly refer to the entire group of
modules from the command line.</para>

<orderedlist>

<listitem><para><application>kdesrc-build</application> allows you to specify modules that are
descendents of a given module, without building the parent module, by using the
syntax <userinput><replaceable>module-name</replaceable>/*</userinput>. It is
actually required in this case since the base module, kdegraphics, is marked as
inactive so that it is not accidentally built along with its children modules.
Specifying the descendent modules allows <application>kdesrc-build</application> to skip around the
disabled module.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><application>kdesrc-build</application> will also not add a given module to the build

<title>Feature Overview</title>

<para>
<application>kdesrc-build</application> features include:
</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>
You can <quote>pretend</quote> to do the operations. If you pass
<option>--pretend</option> or <option>-p</option> on the
command line, the script will give a verbose description of the commands
it is about to execute, without actually executing it. However if you've never
run <application>kdesrc-build</application>, you would want to run the <command>kdesrc-build
<option><link linkend="cmdline-metadata-only">--metadata-only</link></option></command>
command first in order for <option>--pretend</option> to work.

<tip><para>For an even more verbose description of what <application>kdesrc-build</application> is
doing, try using the <option>--debug</option> option.
</para></tip>

</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
<application>kdesrc-build</application> can (with the assistance of the <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> FTP server) allow for
speedy checkouts of
some Subversion modules. If the module you are checking out has already been
packaged at the website, then <application>kdesrc-build</application> will download the snapshot and
prepare it for use on your computer.
</para>

<tip><para>There is generally no need for any special preparation to perform
the initial checkout of a Git module, as the entire Git repository must be
downloaded anyways, so it is easy for the server to determine what to
send.</para></tip>

<para>This is faster for you, and helps to ease the load on the kde.org
anonymous <application>Subversion</application> servers.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para>
Another speedup is provided by starting the build process for a module as soon
as the source code for that module has been downloaded.  (Available since
version 1.6)
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Excellent support for building the <trademark class="trade">Qt</trademark> library (in case the <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> software you
are trying to build depends on a recent <trademark class="trade">Qt</trademark> not available in your
distribution).
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
<application>kdesrc-build</application> does not require a <acronym>GUI</acronym> present to operate. So,
you can build <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> software without needing a graphical environment.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Supports setting default options for all modules (such as the compilation
settings or the configuration options). Such options can normally be changed
for specific modules as well.</para>

<para>Also, <application>kdesrc-build</application> will <link linkend="kdesrc-build-std-flags">add
standard flags</link> as appropriate to save you the trouble and possible
errors from typing them yourself. Nota Bene: this does not apply when a (custom)
toolchain is configured through e.g.:
<link linkend="conf-cmake-toolchain">cmake-toolchain</link>
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
<application>kdesrc-build</application> can checkout a specific <link linkend="using-branches">branch
or tag</link> of a module. You can also ensure that a specific <link linkend="conf-revision">revision</link> is checked out of a module.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
<application>kdesrc-build</application> can automatically switch a source directory to checkout from
a different repository, branch, or tag. This happens automatically when you
change an option that changes what the repository <acronym>URL</acronym> should be, but you must
use the <link linkend="cmdline-src-only">--src-only</link> option to let
<application>kdesrc-build</application> know that it is acceptable to perform the switch.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
<application>kdesrc-build</application> can <link linkend="partial-builds">checkout only portions of a
module</link>, for those situations where you only need one program from a
large module.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
For developers: <application>kdesrc-build</application> will <link linkend="ssh-agent-reminder">remind
you</link> if you use svn+ssh:// but <application>ssh-agent</application> is
not running, as this will lead to repeated password requests from
<application>SSH</application>.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Can <link linkend="deleting-build-dir">delete the build directory</link> of a
module after its installation to save space at the expense of future compilation
time.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
The locations for the directories used by <application>kdesrc-build</application> are configurable (even
per module).
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Can use <application>Sudo</application>, or a different user-specified command
to <link linkend="root-installation">install modules</link> so that
<application>kdesrc-build</application> does not need to be run as the super user.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
<application>kdesrc-build</application> runs <link linkend="build-priority">with reduced priority</link>
by default to allow you to still use your computer while <application>kdesrc-build</application> is
working.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Has support for using <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname>'s <link linkend="using-branches">tags and
branches</link>.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
There is support for <link linkend="resuming">resuming a build</link> from a
given module. You can even <link linkend="ignoring-modules">ignore some
modules</link> temporarily for a given build.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
<application>kdesrc-build</application> will show the <link linkend="build-progress">progress of your
build</link> when using <application>CMake</application>, and will always time the build
process so you know after the fact how long it took.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Comes built-in with a sane set of default options appropriate for building
a base <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> single-user installation from the anonymous source repositories.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Tilde-expansion for your configuration options. For example, you can
specify:
<programlisting>qtdir ~/kdesrc/build/qt</programlisting>
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Automatically sets up a build system, with the source directory not the
same as the build directory, in order to keep the source directory
pristine.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
You can specify global options to apply to every module to check out, and
you can specify options to apply to individual modules as well.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Forced full rebuilds, by running
<application>kdesrc-build</application> with the <option>--refresh-build</option> option.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
You can specify various environment values to be used during the build,
including <envar>KDEDIR</envar>, <envar>QTDIR</envar>, <envar>DO_NOT_COMPILE</envar>,
and <envar>CXXFLAGS</envar>.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Command logging. Logs are dated and numbered so that you always have a
log of a script run. Also, a special symlink called latest is created to
always point to the most recent log entry in the log directory.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
You can check out only a portion of a <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> <application>Subversion</application> module. For example,
you could check out only the <application>taglib</application> from
<application>kdesupport</application>.

<section xml:id="kdesrc-build-logging">
<title><application>kdesrc-build</application>'s build logging</title>

<section xml:id="logging-overview">
<title>Logging overview</title>

<para>Logging is a <application>kdesrc-build</application> feature whereby the output from every command
that <application>kdesrc-build</application> runs is saved to a file for examination later, if
necessary. This is done because it is often necessary to have the output of
these programs when there is a build failure, because there are so many
reasons why a build can fail in the first place.</para>

<section xml:id="log-directory-layout">
<title>Logging directory layout</title>

<para>The logs are always stored under the log directory. The destination of
the log directory is controlled by the <link linkend="conf-log-dir">log-dir</link>
option, which defaults to <filename class="directory"><symbol>${source-dir}</symbol>/log</filename> (where
<symbol>${source-dir}</symbol> is the value of the <link linkend="conf-source-dir">source-dir</link>
option. The in rest of this section, this value will be referred to as
<symbol>${log-dir}</symbol>).</para>

<para>Under <symbol>${log-dir}</symbol>, is a set of directories, one for every
time that <application>kdesrc-build</application> was run. Each directory is named with the date, and
the run number. For instance, the second time that <application>kdesrc-build</application> is run on
May 26, 2004, it would create a directory called <filename>2004-05-26-02</filename>,
where the 2004-05-26 is for the date, and the -02 is the run number.</para>

<para>For your convenience, <application>kdesrc-build</application> will also create a link to the
logs for your latest run, called <filename class="directory">latest</filename>. So the logs for
the most recent <application>kdesrc-build</application> run should always be under <filename class="directory"><symbol>${log-dir}</symbol>/latest</filename>.
</para>

<para>Now, each directory for a <application>kdesrc-build</application> run will itself contain a set of
directories, one for every <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> module that <application>kdesrc-build</application> tries to build. Also,
a file called <filename>build-status</filename> will be contained in the directory,
which will allow you to determine which modules built and which failed.</para>

<note><para>
If a module itself has a submodule (such as extragear/multimedia,
playground/utils, or KDE/kdelibs), then there would actually be a matching
layout in the log directory. For example, the logs for KDE/kdelibs after the
last <application>kdesrc-build</application> run would be found in <filename class="directory"><symbol>${log-dir}</symbol>/latest/KDE/kdelibs</filename>,
and not under <filename class="directory"><symbol>${log-dir}</symbol>/latest/kdelibs</filename>.
</para></note>

<para>In each module log directory, you will find a set of files for each
operation that <application>kdesrc-build</application> performs. If <application>kdesrc-build</application> updates a module,
you may see filenames such as <filename>svn-co.log</filename> (for a
module checkout) or <filename>svn-up.log</filename> (when updating a module
that has already been checked out). If the <command>configure</command>
command was run, then you would expect to see a <filename>configure.log</filename>
in that directory.</para>

<para>If an error occurred, you should be able to see an explanation of why in
one of the files. To help you determine which file contains the error,
<application>kdesrc-build</application> will create a link from the file containing the error (such as
<filename>build-1.log</filename> to a file called <filename>error.log</filename>).</para>

<para>The upshot to all of this is that to see why a module failed to build
after your last <application>kdesrc-build</application>, the file you should look at first is
<filename><symbol>${log-dir}</symbol>/latest/<replaceable>module-name</replaceable>/error.log</filename>.
</para>

<tip><para>If the file <filename>error.log</filename> is empty (especially after
an installation), then perhaps there was no error. Some of the tools used by
the <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> build system will sometimes mistakenly report an error when there was
none.</para>

<para>Also, some commands will evade <application>kdesrc-build</application>'s output redirection and
bypass the log file in certain circumstances (normally when performing the
first <application>Subversion</application> checkout), and the error output in that case is not in the log file
but is instead at the <application>Konsole</application> or terminal where you ran <application>kdesrc-build</application>.</para>

<title>Configuring <application>kdesrc-build</application></title>

<section xml:id="kdesrc-buildrc-overview">
<title>Overview of <application>kdesrc-build</application> configuration</title>

<para>
To use the script, you must have a file in your home directory called
<filename>.kdesrc-buildrc</filename>, which describes the modules you would
like to download and build, and any options or configuration parameters to
use for these modules.
</para>

<section xml:id="kdesrc-buildrc-layout">
<title>Layout of the configuration file</title>

<section xml:id="kdesrc-buildrc-layout-global">
<title>Global configuration</title>

<para>
The configuration file starts with the global options, specified like the
following:
</para>

<programlisting>
global
<replaceable>option-name option-value</replaceable>
<replaceable>[...]</replaceable>
end global
</programlisting>

</section>
<section xml:id="kdesrc-buildrc-layout-modules">
<title>Module configuration</title>

<para>
It is then followed by one or more module sections, specified in one of the
following two forms:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<programlisting>
module <replaceable>module-name</replaceable>
<replaceable>option-name option-value</replaceable>
<replaceable>[...]</replaceable>
end module
</programlisting>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<programlisting>
module-set <replaceable>module-set-name</replaceable>
  repository <userinput>kde-projects</userinput> or <userinput><replaceable>git://host.org/path/to/repo.git</replaceable></userinput>
  use-modules <replaceable>module-names</replaceable>

# Other options may also be set
<replaceable>option-name option-value</replaceable>
<replaceable>[...]</replaceable>
end module-set
</programlisting>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<important><para>Note that the second form, module sets, <emphasis>only works
for Git-based modules</emphasis>.</para></important>

<para>
For Subversion modules, <replaceable>module-name</replaceable> must be a module
from the <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> <application>Subversion</application> repository (for example, kdeartwork or
kde-wallpapers), although it is possible to get around this if you
<link linkend="conf-override-url">manually specify the <application>Subversion</application> URL</link>.
</para>

<para>
For Git modules, the module name can be essentially whatever you'd like, as
long as it does not duplicate any other module name in the configuration. Keep
in mind the source and build directory layout will be based on the module name
if you do not use the <link linkend="conf-dest-dir">dest-dir</link> option.
</para>

<para>However, for Git <emphasis>module sets</emphasis> the
<replaceable>module-names</replaceable> must correspond with actual git modules
in the chosen <option>repository</option>. See <link linkend="conf-git-repository-base">git-repository-base</link> or <link linkend="conf-use-modules">use-modules</link> for more information.
</para>

</section>

<section xml:id="kdesrc-buildrc-option-values">
<title>Processing of option values</title>

<para>In general, the entire line contents after the
<replaceable>option-name</replaceable> is used as the
<replaceable>option-value</replaceable>.</para>

<para>One modification that <application>kdesrc-build</application> performs is that a sequence
<userinput>${<replaceable>name-of-option</replaceable>}</userinput> is replaced
with the value of that option from the global configuration. This allows you
to reference the value of existing options, including options already set by
<application>kdesrc-build</application>.</para>

<para>
To see an example of this in use, see
<xref linkend="make-options-example"/>.</para>

</section>

<section xml:id="kdesrc-buildrc-options-groups">
<title><quote>options</quote> modules</title>

<para>There is a final type of configuration file entry,
<literal>options</literal> groups, which may be given wherever a
<literal>module</literal> or <literal>module-set</literal> may be used.</para>

<programlisting>
options <replaceable>module-name</replaceable>
<replaceable>option-name option-value</replaceable>
<replaceable>[...]</replaceable>
end options
</programlisting>

<para>An <literal>options</literal> group may have options set for it just like
a module declaration, and is associated with an existing module. Any options
set these way will be used to <emphasis>override</emphasis> options set for the
associated module.</para>

<important><para>The associated module name <emphasis>must</emphasis> match the
name given in the <literal>options</literal> declaration. Be careful of
mis-typing the name.</para></important>

<para>This is useful to allow for declaring an entire
<literal>module-set</literal> worth of modules, all using the same options, and
then using <literal>options</literal> groups to make individual changes.</para>

<para><literal>options</literal> groups can also apply to named module sets.
This allows expert users to use a common configuration file (which includes
<literal>module-set</literal> declarations) as a baseline, and then make changes
to the options used by those module-sets in configuration files that
use the <literal><link linkend="kdesrc-buildrc-including">include</link></literal> command to reference
the base configuration.</para>

<example xml:id="ex-options-group">
<title>Example of using options</title>

<para>In this example we choose to build all modules from the <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> multimedia
software grouping. However we want to use a different version of the <application>KMix</application>
application (perhaps for testing a bug fix). It works as follows:</para>

<programlisting>
module-set <replaceable>kde-multimedia-set</replaceable>
  repository <userinput>kde-projects</userinput>
  use-modules <replaceable>kde/kdemultimedia</replaceable>
  branch <replaceable>master</replaceable>
end module-set

# kmix is a part of kde/kdemultimedia group, even though we never named
# kmix earlier in this file, <application>kdesrc-build</application> will figure out the change.
options <replaceable>kmix</replaceable>
  branch <replaceable>KDE/4.12</replaceable>
end options
</programlisting>

<para>Now when you run <application>kdesrc-build</application>, all of the <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> multimedia programs will
be built from the <quote>master</quote> branch of the source repository, but
<application>KMix</application> will be built from the older <quote>KDE/4.12</quote> branch. By using
<literal>options</literal> you didn't have to individually list all the
<emphasis>other</emphasis> <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> multimedia programs to give them the right
branch option.</para>

</example>

<note>
<para>Note that this feature is only available in <application>kdesrc-build</application> from version
1.16, or using the development version of <application>kdesrc-build</application> after
2014-01-12.</para></note>

</section>

</section>

<section xml:id="kdesrc-buildrc-including">
<title>Including other configuration files</title>

<para>
Within the configuration file, you may reference other files by using the
<literal>include</literal> keyword with a file, which will act as if the file
referenced had been inserted into the configuration file at that point.
</para>

<informalexample><para>For example, you could have something like this:</para>
<programlisting>
global
    include <replaceable>~/common-kdesrc-build-options</replaceable>

    # Insert specific options here.

end global
</programlisting>
</informalexample>

<note><para>If you don't specify the full path to the file to include, then
the file will be searched for starting from the directory containing the source
file. This works recursively as well.</para></note>

actual branch to use automatically based on rules encoded by the <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname>
developers (these rules may be viewed in the
<literal>kde-build-metadata</literal> source repository in your source
directory). After a branch is determined that branch is used as if you had
specified it yourself using the <link linkend="conf-branch">branch</link>
option.
</para>

<para>This is useful if you're just trying to maintain up-to-date on some
normal development track without having to pay attention to all the branch name
changes.</para>

<para>The current branch groups (as of 2013-08-11) are:</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para><literal>stable-qt4</literal>, for tracking bugfixes to the
<trademark class="trade">Qt</trademark> 4-based <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> libraries and applications.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><literal>latest-qt4</literal>, for tracking development and new
features for the <trademark class="trade">Qt</trademark> 4-based <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> libraries and
applications.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><literal>kf5-qt5</literal>, for tracking

Frameworks 5, <productname>Plasma</productname> Workspace 2, <abbrev>etc.</abbrev></para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<para>Note that if you <emphasis>do</emphasis> choose a
<literal>branch</literal> yourself, that it will override this setting. The
same is true of other specific branch selection options such as <link linkend="conf-tag">tag</link>.</para>

<para>This option was added in <application>kdesrc-build</application> 1.16-pre2.</para>

<note><para>This option only applies to <literal>kde-projects</literal> <application>Git</application>

</para></note>

</entry>
</row>

<row xml:id="conf-build-dir">
<entry>build-dir</entry>
<entry>Module setting overrides global</entry>
<entry>Use this option to change the directory to contain the built sources. There
are three different ways to use it:

<orderedlist>

<listitem><para>Relative to the <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> <application>Subversion</application> source directory (see <link linkend="conf-source-dir">the source-dir option</link>). This is the default,
and is selected if you type a directory name that does not start with a tilde
(~) or a slash (/).</para> <para>The default value is <filename class="directory">build</filename>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Absolute path. If you specify a path that begins with a /, then
that path is used directly. For example, <filename class="directory">/tmp/kde-obj-dir/</filename>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Relative to your home directory. If you specify a path that
begins with a ~, then the path is used relative to your home directory,
analogous to the shell's tilde-expansion. For example, <filename class="directory">~/builddir</filename> would set the build directory to
<filename class="directory">/home/user-name/builddir</filename>.</para></listitem>

</orderedlist>

Perhaps surprisingly, this option can be changed per module.

</entry>
</row>

<row xml:id="conf-build-when-unchanged">
<entry>build-when-unchanged</entry>
<entry>Module setting overrides global</entry>
<entry><para>Use this option in order to control whether <application>kdesrc-build</application> always
tries to build a module that has not had any source code updates.</para>

<para>By setting <option>build-when-unchanged</option> to
<userinput>true</userinput>, <application>kdesrc-build</application> always attempts the build phase
for a module, even if the module did not have any source code updates. This is
the default setting since it is more likely to lead to a correct
build.</para>

<para>By setting <option>build-when-unchanged</option> to
<userinput>false</userinput>, <application>kdesrc-build</application> will only attempt to run the
build phase for a module if the module has a source code update, or in other
situations where it is likely that a rebuild is actually required. This can save
time, especially if you run <application>kdesrc-build</application> daily, or more frequently.</para>

<important><para>This feature is provided as an optimization only. Like many
other optimizations, there are trade-offs for the correctness of your
installation. For instance, changes to the qt or kdelibs modules may cause
a rebuild of other modules to be necessary, even if the source code doesn't
change at all.</para></important>

</para>

<para>Note that this setting has no effect on <application>Git</application> modules due to the

<para>What this option actually does is configure which network protocol to
prefer when pushing source code for these modules. Normally the very-efficient
<literal>git</literal> protocol is used, but this may be blocked in some
networks (e.g. corporate intranets, public Wi-Fi). An alternative protocol
which is much better supported is the <literal>https</literal> protocol used for

<para>Currently, there are three possible values: <userinput>metadata</userinput>,
<userinput>invent</userinput> and <userinput>flat</userinput></para>
<para>The <userinput>flat</userinput> layout will group all modules directly underneath the top level

layout would be <literal>source/ktp-text-ui</literal> using the <userinput>flat</userinput> layout
instead.
</para>
<para>The <userinput>invent</userinput> layout creates a directory hierarchy mirroring the relative
paths of repositories on <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://invent.kde.org/">invent.kde.org</link>. For example
<literal>source/kde/applications/kate</literal> in the <userinput>metadata</userinput> layout would
be <literal>source/utilities/kate</literal> using the <userinput>invent</userinput> layout instead.
This layout only affects KDE projects. It is a good choice for people starting out with
<application>kdesrc-build</application>.
</para>
<para>Finally, the <userinput>metadata</userinput> layout is the same as the old default
behaviour. This layout organises KDE projects according to the project paths specified in the
project metadata for these modules. This is a good choice if you want a directory layout which
tracks with certain KDE processes, but note that this path is therefore not always stable. As a
result, <application>kdesrc-build</application> may abandon an old copy of the repository and clone a new one for a project
due to changes in the project metadata.</para>

<para>If no modules to build are specified on the command line, then
kdesrc-build will build all modules defined in its configuration file, in the
order listed in that file (although this can be modified by various
configuration file options).</para>

<section xml:id="cmdline-usage-modules">
<title>Specifying modules to build</title>

<para>In general, specifying modules to build is as simple as passing their
module name as you defined it in the configuration file. You can also pass
modules that are part of a module set, either as named on <link linkend="conf-use-modules">use-modules</link>, or the name of the entire module
set itself, if you have given it a name.</para>

<para>In the specific case of module sets based against the <link linkend="kde-projects-module-sets">KDE project database</link>, <application>kdesrc-build</application>
will expand module name components to determine the exact module you
want. For example, <application>kdesrc-build</application>'s KDE project entry locates the project in
<literal>extragear/utils/kdesrc-build</literal>. You could specify any
of the following to build <application>kdesrc-build</application>:</para>

<informalexample>
<screen>
<prompt>%</prompt> <command>kdesrc-build</command> <option><replaceable>+extragear/utils/kdesrc-build</replaceable></option>
<prompt>%</prompt> <command>kdesrc-build</command> <option><replaceable>+utils/kdesrc-build</replaceable></option>
<prompt>%</prompt> <command>kdesrc-build</command> <option><replaceable>+kdesrc-build</replaceable></option>
</screen>
</informalexample>

<note><para>The commands in the previous example preceded the module-name with
a <symbol>+</symbol>. This forces the module name to be interpreted as a module
from the KDE project database, even if that module hasn't been defined in your
configuration file.
</para></note>

<para>Be careful about specifying very generic projects (e.g.
<literal>extragear/utils</literal> by itself), as this can lead to a large
amount of modules being built. You should use the <option>--pretend</option>
option before building a new module set to ensure it is only building the
modules you want.</para>

<para>
If a single module is passed on the command line, then the output is simply the

<title>Basic <application>kdesrc-build</application> features</title>

<section xml:id="using-qt">
<title>qt support</title>
<para><application>kdesrc-build</application> supports building the <trademark class="trade">Qt</trademark> toolkit used by <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> software
as a convenience to users. This support is handled by a special module named
qt.</para>

<note><para><trademark class="trade">Qt</trademark> is developed under a separate repository from <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> software
located at <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/">http://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/</link>.</para></note>

<para>In order to build <trademark class="trade">Qt</trademark>, you should make sure that the
<link linkend="conf-qtdir">qtdir</link> setting is set to the directory you'd
like to install <trademark class="trade">Qt</trademark> to, as described in <xref linkend="configure-data"/>.</para>

<para>You should then ensure that the qt module is added to
your <filename>.kdesrc-buildrc</filename>, before any other modules in the
file. If you are using the sample configuration file, you can simply
uncomment the existing qt module entry.</para>

<para>Now you should verify the <link linkend="conf-repository">repository</link> option and <link linkend="conf-branch">branch</link> options are set appropriately:</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>The first option is to build <trademark class="trade">Qt</trademark> using a mirror maintained
on the <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> source repositories (no other changes are applied, it is simply
a clone of the official source). This is highly recommended due to occasional
issues with cloning the full <trademark class="trade">Qt</trademark> module from its official repository.</para>

<para>You can set the <option>repository</option> option for the qt
module to <userinput>kde:qt</userinput> to use this option.</para>

</itemizedlist>

</section>

<section xml:id="build-priority">
<title>Changing <application>kdesrc-build</application>'s build priority</title>
<para>Programs can run with different priority levels on Operating Systems,
including <trademark class="registered">Linux</trademark> and <acronym>BSD</acronym>. This allows the system to allocate time for the
different programs in accordance with how important they are.
</para>

<para><application>kdesrc-build</application> will normally allocate itself a low priority so that the
rest of the programs on your system are unaffected and can run normally.
Using this technique, <application>kdesrc-build</application> will use extra CPU when it is available.
</para>

<para><application>kdesrc-build</application> will still maintain a high enough priority level so that
it runs before routine batch processes and before CPU donation programs
such as <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/">Seti@Home</link>.
</para>

<para>To alter <application>kdesrc-build</application> so that it uses a higher (or lower) priority
level permanently, then you need to adjust the <link linkend="conf-niceness">niceness</link> setting in the <link linkend="configure-data">configuration file</link>. The <link linkend="conf-niceness">niceness</link> setting
controls how <quote>nice</quote> <application>kdesrc-build</application> is to other programs. In other
words, having a higher <link linkend="conf-niceness">niceness</link> gives <application>kdesrc-build</application> a lower priority. So to
give <application>kdesrc-build</application> a higher priority, reduce the <link linkend="conf-niceness">niceness</link> (and vice versa).
The <link linkend="conf-niceness">niceness</link> can go from 0 (not nice at all, highest priority) to 20 (super
nice, lowest priority).</para>

<para>You can also temporarily change the priority for <application>kdesrc-build</application> by using
the <link linkend="cmdline-nice">--nice</link> <link linkend="cmdline">command line option</link>. The value to
the option is used exactly the same as for <link linkend="conf-niceness">niceness</link>.</para>

<note><para>It is possible for some programs run by the super user to have a
negative nice value, with a correspondingly even higher priority for such
programs. Setting a negative (or even 0) <link linkend="conf-niceness">niceness</link> for <application>kdesrc-build</application> is not
a great idea, as it will not help run time significantly, but will make your
computer seem very sluggish should you still need to use it.
</para></note>

<informalexample>
<para>To run <application>kdesrc-build</application> with a niceness of 15 (a lower priority than
normal):</para>

<screen>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput><command>kdesrc-build</command> <option>--nice=<replaceable>15</replaceable></option></userinput>
</screen>

<para>Or, you can edit the <link linkend="configure-data">configuration file</link> to make the change permanent:</para>

<screen>
    <link linkend="conf-niceness">niceness</link> <replaceable>15</replaceable>
</screen>
</informalexample>

<tip>
<para>The <link linkend="conf-niceness">niceness</link> option only affects the
usage of the computer's processor(s). One other major affect on computer
performance relates to how much data input or output (<acronym>I/O</acronym>) a
program uses. In order to control how much <acronym>I/O</acronym> a program can
use, modern <trademark class="registered">Linux</trademark> operating systems support a similar tool called
<application>ionice</application>. <application>kdesrc-build</application> supports
<application>ionice</application>, (but only to enable or disable it
completely) using the <link linkend="conf-use-idle-io-priority">use-idle-io-priority</link> option,
since <application>kdesrc-build</application> version 1.12.
</para>
</tip>

</section>

<section xml:id="root-installation">
<title>Installation as the superuser</title>
<para>You may wish to have <application>kdesrc-build</application> run the installation with super user
privileges. This may be for the unrecommended system-wide installation.
This is also useful when using a recommended single user <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> build, however.
This is because some modules (especially kdebase) install programs that will
briefly need elevated permissions when run. They are not able to achieve these
permission levels unless they are installed with the elevated permissions.
</para>

<para>You could simply run <application>kdesrc-build</application> as the super user directly, but this
is not recommended, since the program has not been audited for that kind of use.
Although it should be safe to run the program in this fashion, it is better to
avoid running as the super user when possible.</para>

<para>To take care of this, <application>kdesrc-build</application> provides the <link linkend="conf-make-install-prefix">make-install-prefix</link>
option. You can use this option to specify a command to use to perform the
installation as another user. The recommended way to use this command is with
the <application>Sudo</application> program, which will run the install command as the super user.
</para>

<informalexample>
<para>For example, to install all modules using <application>Sudo</application>,
you could do something like this:</para>

<screen>
global
  <link linkend="conf-make-install-prefix">make-install-prefix</link> <replaceable>sudo</replaceable>
  # Other options
end global
</screen>

<para>To use <link linkend="conf-make-install-prefix">make-install-prefix</link> for only a single module, this would work:
</para>

<screen>
module <replaceable>svn-module-name</replaceable>
  <link linkend="conf-make-install-prefix">make-install-prefix</link> <replaceable>sudo</replaceable>
end module
</screen>
</informalexample>

<section xml:id="build-progress">
<title>Showing the progress of a module build</title>

building a module; that way you know about how much longer it will take to
build a module.

<section xml:id="advanced-features">
<title>Advanced features</title>

<section xml:id="partial-builds">
<title>Partially building a module</title>
<para>It is possible to build only pieces from a single <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> module. For
example, you may want to compile only one program from a module. <application>kdesrc-build</application>
has features to make this easy. There are several complementing ways to
do this.
</para>

<section xml:id="checking-out-parts">
<title>Checking out portions of a module</title>

<para>This is perhaps the best way to do this. When it works, it will save you
download time and disk space. What happens is that <application>kdesrc-build</application> will download
only the parts of a module that you specify. This is done using the <link linkend="conf-checkout-only">checkout-only</link>
option for a module, which will specify a list of directories to download.
</para>

<tip><para>
If you do not already know what to download from a module, it may be a good idea
to browse the <application>Subversion</application> layout for a module first, using
<link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://websvn.kde.org/branches/KDE/4.6/">WebSVN</link>. <!--FIXME outdated-->
</para></tip>

<informalexample>
<para>To only grab <application>KUser</application> and <application>KSystemLog</application> from
kdeadmin, you could use <link linkend="conf-checkout-only">checkout-only</link> like this:</para>

<screen>
module <replaceable>kdeadmin</replaceable>
  <link linkend="conf-checkout-only">checkout-only</link> <replaceable>kuser ksystemlog</replaceable>
end module
</screen>

</informalexample>

<important><para>The directories will be built in the order they are listed
in the option. If one of the directories needs something else from the module
to compile, then you need to make sure they are both in the <link linkend="conf-checkout-only">checkout-only</link>
line, and that the required dependency goes before the directory that needs it.</para>

<para>Also, sometimes an application may need other directories and it is hard
to figure out what they are, which may require some trial and error of constantly
adding directories to the option to figure out. This option depends on support
from the build system of the module, so it is only useful for modules that are
collections of individual applications.</para>
</important>

<para>One final note to make about this option: If you change the value of this
option, you should use <userinput><command>kdesrc-build</command>
<option><link linkend="cmdline-refresh-build">--refresh-build</link></option> <option><replaceable>module</replaceable></option></userinput>
in order to ensure that the module is reconfigured properly. In addition,
<application>kdesrc-build</application> will never remove existing files if you take away the number of
directories from your <link linkend="conf-checkout-only">checkout-only</link> option, or add the option to a module that
has already been checked out.</para>

</section>

<section xml:id="not-compiling">
<title>Removing directories from a build</title>
<para>Instead of restricting what is downloaded, it is possible to download
everything but have the build system leave out a few directories when it does
the build. This may be useful if one directory always breaks and is
unnecessary to the rest of the module.
</para>

<para>This is controlled with the <link linkend="conf-do-not-compile">do-not-compile</link> option. It works similar
to the <link linkend="conf-checkout-only">checkout-only</link> option just described, in that it is simply a list of
directories that should not be compiled.</para>

<important><para>
Also like <link linkend="conf-checkout-only">checkout-only</link>, this option requires at least that the
build system for the module is reconfigured after changing
it. This is done using the <userinput><command>kdesrc-build</command>
<option><link linkend="cmdline-reconfigure">--reconfigure</link></option>
<option><replaceable>module</replaceable></option></userinput> command.
</para></important>

<informalexample>
<para>To remove the <filename class="directory">python</filename> directory
from the kdebindings build process:</para>

<screen>
module <replaceable>kdebindings</replaceable>
  <link linkend="conf-do-not-compile">do-not-compile</link> <replaceable>python</replaceable>
end module
</screen>

<note><para>This function depends on some standard conventions used in most
<orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> modules. Therefore it may not work for all programs.</para></note>

<section xml:id="using-branches">
<title>Branching and tagging support for <application>kdesrc-build</application></title>

<section xml:id="branches-and-tags">
<title>What are branches and tags?</title>

<para><application>Subversion</application> supports managing the history of the <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> source code. <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname>
uses this support to create branches for development, and to tag the repository
every so often with a new version release.
</para>

<para>For example, the <application>KMail</application> developers may be working on a new feature in
a different branch in order to avoid breaking the version being used by most
developers. This branch has development ongoing inside it, even while the
main branch (called /trunk) may have development going on inside of it.
</para>

<para>A tag, on the other hand, is a snapshot of the source code repository
at a position in time. This is used by the <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> administration team to mark
off a version of code suitable for release and still allow the developers to
work on the code.
</para>

<para>In <application>Subversion</application>, there is no difference between branches, tags, or trunk within
the code. It is only a convention used by the developers. This makes it
difficult to properly support branches and tags within <application>kdesrc-build</application>. However,
there are some things that can be done.
</para>

</section>

<section xml:id="branch-support">
<title>How to use branches and tags</title>

<para>Support for branches and tags is handled by a set of options, which
range from a generic request for a version, to a specific <acronym>URL</acronym> to download
for advanced users.
</para>

<para>The easiest method is to use the <link linkend="conf-branch">branch</link> and <link linkend="conf-tag">tag</link> options. You simply
use the option along with the name of the desired branch or tag for a module,
and <application>kdesrc-build</application> will try to determine the appropriate location within the
<orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> repository to download from. For most <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> modules this works very
well.</para>

<informalexample>
<para>To download kdelibs from <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> 4.6 (which is simply known as the 4.6 branch):
</para>

<screen>
module kdelibs
  branch <replaceable>4.6</replaceable>
  # other options...
end module
</screen>

<para>Or, to download kdemultimedia as it was released with <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> 4.6.1:</para>

<screen>
module kdemultimedia
  tag <replaceable>4.6.1</replaceable>
  # other options...
end module
</screen>

</informalexample>

<tip><para>You can specify a global branch value. But if you do so, do not forget
to specify a different branch for modules that should not use the global branch!

<title>Automatic rebuilds</title>

<para><application>kdesrc-build</application> used to include features to automatically attempt to
rebuild the module after a failure (as sometimes this re-attempt would work,
due to bugs in the build system at that time). Thanks to switching to <application>CMake</application>
the build system no longer suffers from these bugs, and so <application>kdesrc-build</application> will
not try to build a module more than once. There are situations where
<application>kdesrc-build</application> will automatically take action though:</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>If you change <link linkend="conf-configure-flags">configure-flags</link>
or <link linkend="conf-cmake-options">cmake-options</link> for a module, then
<application>kdesrc-build</application> will detect that and automatically re-run configure or cmake
for that module.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>If the buildsystem does not exist (even if <application>kdesrc-build</application> did
not delete it) then <application>kdesrc-build</application> will automatically re-create it. This is
useful to allow for performing a full <link linkend="cmdline-refresh-build">--refresh-build</link> for a specific module
without having that performed on other modules.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

</section>

<section xml:id="manual-rebuilds">
<title>Manually rebuilding a module</title>
<para>If you make a change to a module's option settings, or the module's
source code changes in a way <application>kdesrc-build</application> does not recognize, you may need to
manually rebuild the module.</para>

<para>You can do this by simply running <userinput><command>kdesrc-build</command>
 <option>--refresh-build</option> <option><replaceable>module</replaceable></option></userinput>.
</para>

<para>If you would like to have <application>kdesrc-build</application> automatically rebuild the module
during the next normal build update instead, you can create a special file.
Every module has a build directory. If you create a file called <filename>.refresh-me</filename>
in the build directory for a module, <application>kdesrc-build</application> will rebuild the module
next time the build process occurs, even if it would normally perform the
faster incremental build.</para>

<tip>
<para>By default, the build directory is <filename class="directory">~/kdesrc/build/<replaceable>module</replaceable>/</filename>.
If you change the setting of the <link linkend="conf-build-dir">build-dir</link> option, then use that instead of
<filename class="directory">~/kdesrc/build</filename>.</para>
</tip>

<informalexample>
<para>Rebuild using <filename>.refresh-me</filename> for module <replaceable>kdelibs</replaceable>:</para>

<section xml:id="changing-environment">
<title>Changing environment variable settings</title>
<para>Normally <application>kdesrc-build</application> uses the environment that is present when
starting up when running programs to perform updates and builds. This is useful
for when you are running <application>kdesrc-build</application> from the command line.</para>

<para>However, you may want to change the setting for environment variables
that <application>kdesrc-build</application> does not provide an option for directly. (For instance,
to setup any required environment variables when running <application>kdesrc-build</application> on
a timer such as <application>Cron</application>) This is possible with the <link linkend="conf-set-env">set-env</link> option.</para>

<para>Unlike most options, it can be set more than once, and it accepts two
entries, separated by a space. The first one is the name of the environment
variable to set, and the remainder of the line is the value.</para>

<section xml:id="resuming-failed">
<title>Resuming a failed or canceled build</title>

<para>You can tell <application>kdesrc-build</application> to start building from a different module
than it normally would. This can be useful when a set of modules failed, or
if you canceled a build run in the middle. You can control this using the
<link linkend="cmdline-resume-from">--resume-from</link> option and the <link linkend="cmdline-resume-after">--resume-after</link> option.</para>

<note><para>Older versions of <application>kdesrc-build</application> would skip the source update when
resuming a build. This is no longer done by default, but you can always use
the <option>--no-src</option> command line option
to skip the source update.</para></note>

<informalexample>
<para>Resuming the build starting from kdebase:</para>

</screen>
</informalexample>

<para>If the last <application>kdesrc-build</application> build ended with a build failure, you can also
use the <link linkend="cmdline-resume">--resume</link> command line option,
which resumes the last build starting at the module that failed. The source and
metadata updates are skipped as well (but if you need these, it's generally
better to use <link linkend="cmdline-resume-from">--resume-from</link>
instead).</para>

<para>Similar to the way you can <link linkend="resuming-failed">resume the

normally, but ignore a set of modules.</para>

<para>You can do this using the <link linkend="cmdline-ignore-modules">--ignore-modules</link> option. This option tells
<application>kdesrc-build</application> to ignore all the modules on the command line when

<title>Changing global options</title>
<para>You can change the setting of options read from the <link linkend="configure-data">configuration file</link> directly
from the command line. This change will override the configuration file
setting, but is only temporary. It only takes effect as long as it is still
present on the command line.</para>

<para><application>kdesrc-build</application> allows you to change options named like <replaceable>option-name</replaceable>
by passing an argument on the command line in the form <userinput><option>--<replaceable>option-name</replaceable>=value</option></userinput>.
<application>kdesrc-build</application> will recognize whether it does not know what the option is, and search
for the name in its list of option names. If it does not recognize the name, it
will warn you, otherwise it will remember the value you set it to and override
any setting from the configuration file.</para>

<informalexample>
<para>Setting the <link linkend="conf-source-dir">source-dir</link> option to <filename>/dev/null</filename> for

<section xml:id="deleting-build-dir">
<title>Removing unneeded directories after a build</title>
<para>Are you short on disk space but still want to run a bleeding-edge
<orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> checkout?  <application>kdesrc-build</application> can help reduce your disk usage when building
<orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> from <application>Subversion</application>.</para>

<note><para>Be aware that building <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> does take a lot of space. There are
several major space-using pieces when using <application>kdesrc-build</application>:</para></note>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>The actual source checkout can take up a fair amount of space.
The default modules take up about 1.6 gigabytes of on-disk space. You can reduce
this amount by making sure that you are only building as many modules as you
actually want. <application>kdesrc-build</application> will not delete source code from disk even if you
delete the entry from the <link linkend="configure-data">configuration file</link>, so make sure that you go and delete unused
source checkouts from the source directory. Note that the source files are
downloaded from the Internet, you <emphasis>should not</emphasis> delete them
if you are actually using them, at least until you are done using
<application>kdesrc-build</application>.</para>

<para>Also, if you already have a <trademark class="trade">Qt</trademark> installed by your distribution (and
the odds are good that you do), you probably do not need to install the
qt module. That will shave about 200 megabytes off of the on-disk source
size.</para>

<para>One thing to note is that due to the way <application>Subversion</application> works: there are actually
two files on disk for every file checked-out from the repository. <application>kdesrc-build</application>
does not have code at this point to try and minimize the source size when the
source is not being used.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para><application>kdesrc-build</application> will create a separate build directory to build the source
code in. Sometimes <application>kdesrc-build</application> will have to copy a source directory to
create a fake build directory. When this happens, space-saving symlinks are
used, so this should not be a hassle on disk space. The build directory will
typically be much larger than the source directory for a module. For example,
the build directory for kdebase is about 1050 megabytes, whereas kdebase's
source is only around 550 megabytes.</para>

<para>Luckily, the build directory is not required after a module has
successfully been built and installed. <application>kdesrc-build</application> can automatically
remove the build directory after installing a module, see the examples below
for more information. Note that taking this step will make it impossible
for <application>kdesrc-build</application> to perform the time-saving incremental builds.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para>
Finally, there is disk space required for the actual installation of
<orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname>, which does not run from the build directory. This typically takes less
space than the build directory. It is harder to get exact figures however.
</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>How do you reduce the space requirements of <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname>?  One way is to
use the proper compiler flags, to optimize for space reduction instead of
for speed. Another way, which can have a large effect, is to remove debugging
information from your <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> build.
</para>

<warning><para>
You should be very sure you know what you are doing before deciding to remove
debugging information. Running bleeding-edge software means you are running
software which is potentially much more likely to crash than a stable release.
If you are running software without debugging information, it can be very
hard to create a good bug report to get your bug resolved, and you will likely
have to re-enable debugging information for the affected application and
rebuild to help a developer fix the crash. So, remove debugging information
at your own risk!
</para></warning>

<informalexample>
<para>Removing the build directory after installation of a module. The source
directory is still kept, and debugging is enabled:</para>

  configure-flags      --enable-debug

<section xml:id="module-concept">
<title>The <quote>Module</quote></title>

<para><orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> groups its software into <quote>modules</quote> of various size.
This was initially a loose grouping of a few large modules, but with the
introduction of the <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</link>-based <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://commits.kde.org/">source code repositories</link>, these large
modules were further split into many smaller modules.
</para>

<para><application>kdesrc-build</application> uses this module concept as well. In essence, a
<quote>module</quote> is a grouping of code that can be downloaded, built,
tested, and installed.
</para>

<section xml:id="single-modules">
<title>Individual modules</title>

<para>It is easy to set <application>kdesrc-build</application> to build a single module. The following
listing is an example of what a declaration for a Subversion-based module would
look like in <link linkend="kdesrc-buildrc">the configuration
file</link>.</para>

<programlisting>
module <replaceable>kdefoo</replaceable>
    <option><replaceable>cmake-options -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug</replaceable></option>
end module
</programlisting>

<tip><para>This is a Subversion-based module since it doesn't use a <link linkend="conf-repository">repository</link> option. Also, the
<option>cmake-options</option> option is listed as an example only, it is not
required.</para></tip>

</section>
<section xml:id="module-groups">
<title>Groups of related modules</title>

<para>Now most <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> source modules are Git-based <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname>, and are normally
combined into groups of modules.</para>

<para><application>kdesrc-build</application> therefore supports groups of modules as well, using
<link linkend="module-sets">module sets</link>. An example:</para>

<programlisting>
module-set <replaceable>base-modules</replaceable>
    <option>repository</option> kde-projects
    <option>use-modules</option> <replaceable>kde-runtime kde-workspace kde-baseapps</replaceable>
end module-set
</programlisting>

<tip><para>You can leave the module set name (<replaceable>base-modules</replaceable>
in this case) empty if you like. This <option>repository</option> setting tells
<application>kdesrc-build</application> where to download the source from, but you can also use a
<symbol>git://</symbol> URL.</para></tip>

<para>One special feature of the <quote><option>repository</option>
<literal>kde-projects</literal></quote> is that <application>kdesrc-build</application> will
automatically include any Git modules that are grouped under the modules you
list (in the KDE Project database).</para>
</section>

<section xml:id="module-branch-groups">
<title>Module <quote>branch groups</quote></title>

<para>Taking the concept of a <link linkend="module-groups">group of
modules</link> further, the <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> developers eventually found that
synchronizing the names of the Git branches across a large number of
repositories was getting difficult, especially during the development push for
the new <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> Frameworks for <trademark class="trade">Qt</trademark> 5.
</para>

<para>So the concept of <quote>branch groups</quote> was developed, to allow
users and developers to select one of only a few groups, and allow the script
to automatically select the appropriate Git branch.
</para>

<para><application>kdesrc-build</application> supports this feature as of version 1.16-pre2, via the
<link linkend="conf-branch-group">branch-group</link> option.
</para>

<example xml:id="ex-branch-group">
<title>Example of using branch-group</title>

<para>branch-group can be used in the configuration file as follows:
</para>

<programlisting>
global
    # Select KDE Frameworks 5 and other Qt5-based apps
    <option>branch-group</option> <replaceable>kf5-qt5</replaceable>

    # Other global options here ...

module-set
    # branch-group only works for kde-projects
    <option>repository</option> kde-projects

    # branch-group is inherited from the one set globally, but could
    # specified here.

    <option>use-modules</option> <replaceable>kdelibs kde-workspace</replaceable>
end module-set

# kdelibs's branch will be "frameworks"
# kde-workspace's branch will be "master" (as of August 2013)
</programlisting>

<para>In this case the same <literal>branch-group</literal> gives different
branch names for each Git module.
</para>
</example>

<para>This feature requires some data maintained by the <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> developers in a Git
repository named <literal>kde-build-metadata</literal>, however this module
will be included automatically by <application>kdesrc-build</application> (though you may see it appear
in the script output).
</para>

<tip><para><orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> modules that do not have a set branch name for the branch

or, if you are not building qt (and are using your system <trademark class="trade">Qt</trademark> instead), add
this instead:

PATH=$KDEDIR/bin:$QTDIR/bin:$PATH

# Act appropriately if LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not already set.

  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$KDEDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

export KDEDIRS PATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
If you are not using a dedicated user, set a different $<envar>KDEHOME</envar>
for your new environment in your <filename>.bash_profile</filename>:

<programlisting>
export KDEHOME="${HOME}/.kde-svn"

# Create it if needed
[ ! -e ~/.kde-svn ] &amp;&amp; mkdir ~/.kde-svn
</programlisting>
</para>

<note><para>
If later your K Menu is empty or too crowded with applications from your
distribution, you may have to set the <acronym>XDG</acronym> environment
variables in your <filename>.bash_profile</filename>:</para>
<programlisting>
XDG_CONFIG_DIRS="/etc/xdg"
XDG_DATA_DIRS="${KDEDIR}/share:/usr/share"
export XDG_CONFIG_DIRS XDG_DATA_DIRS</programlisting></note>

<title>Starting <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname></title>

<para>
Now that you have adjusted your environment settings to use the correct <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname>,
it is important to ensure that the correct <command>startkde</command> script
is used as well.
</para>

<para>
Open the <filename>.xinitrc</filename> text file from the home directory, or
create it if necessary. Add the line:

<programlisting>
<command>exec</command> <option>${KDEDIR}/bin/startkde</option>
</programlisting>
</para>

<important><para>On some distributions, it may be necessary to perform the same
steps with the <filename>.xsession</filename> file, also in the home directory.
This is especially true when using graphical login managers such as
<application>kdm</application>, <application>gdm</application>, or <application>xdm</application>.</para>
</important>

<para>
Now start your fresh <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname>: in <acronym>BSD</acronym> and <trademark class="registered">Linux</trademark> systems with virtual terminal support,
<keycombo action="simul"><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F1</keycap></keycombo> ... <keycombo action="simul"><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F12</keycap></keycombo> keystroke combinations are used to switch to Virtual Console 1 through 12.
This allows you to run more than one desktop environment at the same time. The fist six are
text terminals and the following six are graphical displays.
</para>

<para>
If when you start your computer you are presented to the graphical display
manager instead, you can use the new <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> environment, even if it is not listed
as an option. Most display managers, including <application>kdm</application>, have an option to use
a <quote>Custom Session</quote> when you login. With this option, your session settings are
loaded from the <filename>.xsession</filename> file in your home directory. If
you have already modified this file as described above, this option should load
you into your new <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> installation.
</para>

<para>If it does not, there is something else you can try that should normally
work: Press <keycombo action="simul"><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F2</keycap></keycombo>,
and you will be presented to a text terminal. Log in using the dedicated user
and type:
</para>

<screen>
<command>startx</command> <option>--</option> <option>:1</option>
</screen>

<tip>
<para>
You can run the <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> from sources and the old <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> at the same time! Log in
using your regular user, start the stable <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> desktop. Press <keycombo action="simul"><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F2</keycap></keycombo> (or
<keycap>F1</keycap>, <keycap>F3</keycap>, etc..), and you will be presented
with a text terminal. Log in using the dedicated <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> <application>Subversion</application> user and
type:</para>

<screen>
<command>startx</command> <option>--</option> <option>:1</option>
</screen>

<para>You can go back to the <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname> desktop of your regular user by pressing the
shortcut key for the already running desktop. This is normally
<keycombo action="simul"><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F7</keycap></keycombo>, you may need
to use <keycap>F6</keycap> or <keycap>F8</keycap> instead. To return to your
<application>kdesrc-build</application>-compiled <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname>, you would use the same sequence, except with the
next function key. For example, if you needed to enter <keycombo action="simul"><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F7</keycap></keycombo>
to switch to your regular <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname>, you would need to enter
<keycombo action="simul"><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F8</keycap></keycombo> to go back
to your <application>kdesrc-build</application> <orgname class="nonprofit">KDE</orgname>.</para>
